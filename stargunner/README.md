StarGunner
==========

A simple game made by myself and Cody Prior during our Senior year CSC 165 Game Architecture class. You can 
find instructions on how to play as well as specifics on what major pieces we each worked on, in the User Guide.

The game may not currently be working in 1-player mode, as the project was geared towards 2-player networked play.
